# Telecom Churn Prediction

## Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry, where customers can easily switch providers. This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning, enabling telecom companies to take proactive retention measures.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to accurately predict which customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions. By leveraging customer-level data, including usage patterns, demographics, and service subscriptions, we aim to provide insights that help reduce churn rates and minimize revenue loss.

## Importance
- Customer retention is more cost-effective than acquisition.
- Identifying churn-prone customers enables targeted retention strategies.
- Proactive interventions can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as:
- **Demographics** (age, gender, region, etc.)
- **Service subscription details** (plan type, contract duration, additional services, etc.)
- **Usage patterns** (call duration, internet usage, number of complaints, etc.)
- **Billing information** (monthly charges, payment method, overdue payments, etc.)
- **Churn label** (whether the customer churned or not)

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying trends and patterns
   - Understanding correlations between features

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features based on insights from EDA
   - Selecting the most relevant features for prediction

4. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Trying multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
   - Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC

5. **Deployment & Monitoring**
   - Deploying the best-performing model using Flask/FastAPI
   - Integrating the model into a web app for real-time predictions
   - Monitoring model performance and updating as needed

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and modeling
- **Flask/FastAPI** for deployment
- **GitHub** for version control
